# YouTube-ad-skipper
This program will automatically overstamp Youtube ads by taking a screenshot of your monitor  
and then comparing that screenshot with sample ad screenshots (see below).  
If the program detects the "Skip Ads" button on the previously taken screenshot,  
the program will automatically navigate there with the mouse and press the button fully automatically.

## usage of the YouTube-ad-skipper
Once you have started the program, you can open Youtube in the browser and start a Youtube video.  
The program will do the rest. If you want to stop the program you just have to press the x key for 3 seconds.  
Then the program will exit.  
**If your language in Youtube settings is not English, you need to make your own screenshots of the buttons  
and paste them into the program folder instead of the already existing ones,  
otherwise the program will not recognize the buttons with them and the ads will not be skipped.**
